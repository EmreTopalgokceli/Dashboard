# Dashboard

**Overview**

This Python code simulates the effects of policy change in country risk assessments for an insurance company that ensures the non-payment risk of its insured's international transactions. It consists of three parts: Policy Determination, Function, and Key. The code produces a dashboard that shows how the company's total premium changes, how many insureds will be affected, which of them are strongly affected, and how the revenue and average premium rate will change by country. Due to data privacy, the names of countries and customers are anonymized using Python's Anonymizedf library.

**Policy Determination**

In this part, the user inputs the countries and their new assessments as inputs.

**Function**

The Function part is the main structure of the code. It calculates each factor and produces the charts on the dashboard accordingly.

**Key**

In this part, the dictionary created in Policy Determination is put as an input of the function created in Function.

**Usage**

To use this code, simply run the Python file in a Python environment. Input the countries and their new assessments in the Policy Determination part, and the dashboard will be generated showing how the changes affect the company's portfolio. Please note that due to data privacy, the names of countries and customers are anonymized.
